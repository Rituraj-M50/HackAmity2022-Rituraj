Here, I have taken a very simple approach of sending the processed speech data directly to the google search. I am taking the user input in two different forms i.e. Text and Speech. The text data is directly sent to the google search query but the speech data should be processed before sending it to the search query. For that purpose, I have used the SpeechRecognition - Web API which makes sure that the web browser takes the user input in audio form and process it. Web APIs documentation can be accessed through the given link:

To create a modern and mobile-first web application, I used the Bootstrap library which can includes CSS and JS Components, Plugins and more. I used the Bootstrap CSS (bootstrap.min.css) and Bootstrap JS (bootstrap.min.js) in this Virtual Math Tutor App. I used Font-Awesome and Icons8 to get the graphic elements in my web application.

In addition to this, I also added an extra feature called "Connect with Us" in which i have added a basic form and the data is being sent to the Realtime Database for this purpose i used the Google Firebase Integration in this app.

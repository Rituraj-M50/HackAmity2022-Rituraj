**Problem Statement:** Virtual Math Tutor App

**Description:** <br><br>
Design an application that can be used to solve simple math problems asked bythe user.The application should be able to take both text and speech as the input from
the user. Let's assume the user asks the following question to the application - “What is fourteen divided by two?” The application should be able to process the speech input from the user in this case and return “7” as the answers/output (14 ÷ 2 = 7). <br>

**Scope of the problem:** <br><br>
• The application works with the user inputs (either speech or text) in the English
language only
• For simplicity the question asked to the application will deal only with positive
numbers. Decimals and negative numbers are not allowed. For example, these
inputs are not allowed:
o What is the answer to 14.5 plus 5 ? (Input text contains decimal numbers)
o What is minus five times 4 ? (Input speech contains a negative number: -5
in this case)

• The numbers in the input text/speech can be of maximum 3 digits each.
o Some examples of valid inputs:
▪ What is five hundred and forty six minus twenty eight ? (Speech
input)
▪ What is 49 ✕ 3 ? (Text input)

• The input expression or voice command consists of a single mathematical
operator. Allowed operators are
o plus operator (+)
o minus operator (-)
o division operator (÷)
o multiplication operator (×)
• Apart from the above operations the application should also able to perform the
following operations
o Finding LCM (Least Common Multiple)
o Finding GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

**Expected Input:**

• The application should handle both text and speech as the input.
• Participants are expected to provide solutions that can work well with both
text and speech.
• Participants can also submit the application that takes input only in one
form (either text or speech), this will not lead to disqualification but it will
certainly be accounted for during the evaluation.
Expected output:
A working application that is able to answer simple math problems asked by the
user.

**Submission requirements:**

• Codebase that is used for developing the application (for both front-end and back-
end).

• A short video recording of the application (demonstrating the working using 2-3
example inputs)
• A readme.txt file explaining the overall architecture and approach taken.
• A requirement.txt file listing out the packages/libraries used for building the app.
• Any other file participants think are necessary for the submissions (include the
description of the same in readme.txt)

App evaluation:
• The input (both text and speech) to the application will be in English language only.
• The application will be evaluated against a predefined set of test inputs (containing
both text and speech) which will not be shared with the participants.
• The evaluation criteria are given below:
o The correctness of the output the application produces for a given input.
o Application ability to work with both text and speech input.
o Ability to handle bugs and unexpected inputs.
o Application's user interface.
o Overall experience to the user using the application.
o App should be cross platform (Android/iOS) (Nice to have)
